# Chest-X-ray-Classification-Pneumonia-vs.-Normal-
A deep learning project built to classify chest X-ray images into PNEUMONIA or NORMAL classes. The solution leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for classification and uses Grad-CAM for model explainability. This project showcases how AI can support medical diagnostics with high accuracy and transparency.
