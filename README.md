# ü©ª Chest X-ray Classification: Pneumonia vs. Normal (Deep Learning with Grad-CAM)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cd956c2-191f-4a68-9c04-e1d7e4ca4e49)


A deep learning project built to classify chest X-ray images into **PNEUMONIA** or **NORMAL** classes. The solution leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture for classification and uses **Grad-CAM** for model explainability. This project showcases how AI can support medical diagnostics with high accuracy and transparency.
